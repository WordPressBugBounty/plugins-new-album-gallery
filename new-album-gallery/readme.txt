= Why Use Album Gallery? =

Managing multiple images on your website can get messy. Album Gallery solves this by letting you group related photos into albums, similar to how you'd organize a physical photo album. Each album displays as a cover image, and when visitors click on it, they see all the photos inside with a smooth lightbox viewer.

The album gallery works on all devices - desktops, tablets, and phones. Your albums automatically adjust to fit any screen size, so your photos always look good no matter how visitors access your site.

= What You Can Create =

* **Photo Albums** - Group vacation photos, family events, or any image collection
* **Video Albums** - Organize video content with thumbnail previews
* **Mixed Media Albums** - Combine photos and videos in the same album
* **Portfolio Galleries** - Showcase your work with hover effects

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create my first album? =

After activating the plugin, go to Album Gallery in your WordPress admin menu. Click "Add New" to create a new album.

In the album settings, you'll find lightbox configuration options. You can adjust settings like navigation arrows, close button position, and overlay color to match your site's design.
